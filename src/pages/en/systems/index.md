## Various Web Services and Software

- **[Zoom](/en/zoom/)**: This is a web conferencing system. Under the University of Tokyo's license, you can host meetings with up to 300 participants and a maximum duration of 30 hours.

You can use your University of Tokyo email address (`xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`) through Gmail. When you create a UTokyo Account, it enables a sharing setting called "limited access", which restricts visibility to UTokyo Accounts, a feature not available with regular Google accounts. Even if you already have a Google account, you will need to set up your UTokyo Account to access pages restricted to UTokyo Accounts.
- **[UTokyo Microsoft License](/en/microsoft/)**: This service allows you to use Microsoft's system with your university account. You can download Microsoft Office applications, such as Word and Excel, for free. Similar to Google, it enables a sharing setting called "limited access", restricting visibility to university accounts. To access such restricted pages, you must ensure that your university account is set up for use.
- **[UTokyo Slack](/en/slack/)**: This is a type of business chat tool used for communication through text messages. A key feature is the ability to create multiple "channels" where text messages can be posted, allowing separate conversations to take place simultaneously. In UTokyo Slack, "workspaces", which are units where people gather to communicate, can be created upon request by faculty and staff members.
- **[Slido](/en/slido/)**: This is a web service that provides features for interactive communication with participants during classes, meetings, and lectures, such as Q&A sessions, live polls, and surveys. It integrates with Webex, allowing you to access premium features by signing in with your University of Tokyo Webex account.

- [For Students]**[Windows Education for students](/en/microsoft/windows_education_for_students)**: This is a license to upgrade to the Education edition of Windows 10 or Windows 11. Please note that this license is for upgrading only and cannot be used for a clean installation.
