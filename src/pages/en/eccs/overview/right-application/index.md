If you wish to use ECCS, you must obtain the "Right to use the ECCS" in advance.

Once you have obtained the right, you can use ECCS with your UTokyo Account username (a 10-digit common ID) and password.

## The services that require the Right to use the ECCS

You need to obtain the Right to use the ECCS to use the following services.

- [ECCS terminals (Mac environment, Windows environment)](/en/eccs/)

Still, you do not need to obtain Right to use the ECCS to use these either.
