## What are the Polls in Zoom?

{:#about}
The polling feature in Zoom allows the meeting host and co-hosts to gather responses from their participants in various formats, such as single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions. In addition to regular polls, the host and co-hosts can conduct quizzes in which they can set correct answers for closed-ended questions.

Additionally, other interaction methods with participants include [the reaction feature (such as raised hand and emoji)](../reaction/) and [the chat function (in Japanese)](/en/zoom/usage/chat). Outside of Zoom, using [Google Forms](/articles/google-form/) is another option. Choose and utilize the appropriate method that best suits your purpose.
