The University of Tokyo has introduced multi-factor authentication to UTokyo Account to improve information system security.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process in which users prove their identity using at least two pieces of evidence. In addition to passwords, users are asked to verify their identity via SMS, authentication applications, or other methods when signing into their accounts. MFA improves security by reducing the possibility of someone being able to sign in to your account even if your password is known to someone else for some reason.

On the UTokyo Account, MFA is enabled by users setting up their own initial setup, and we are asking **all users** with a UTokyo Account to enable it. Therefore, some information systems are disabled until you have enabled MFA. It is very important to ensure the security of your UTokyo Account, not only to protect your personal information but also to protect the information assets held by the university, so we ask you to use multi-factor authentication.

  Please follow the setup procedures in the "[Initial Setup Procedures for Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts](/en/utokyo_account/mfa/initial)".
